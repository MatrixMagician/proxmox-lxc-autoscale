# LXC AutoScale

Welcome to the documentation for **ðŸš€ LXC AutoScale**.

LXC AutoScale is a resource management daemon specifically designed for Proxmox environments. It automatically adjusts CPU and memory allocations and can clone LXC containers based on real-time usage metrics and predefined thresholds. Can be run locally or remotely to make your containers always optimized for performance, managing spikes in demand, and optionally preserving resources during off-peak hours.
