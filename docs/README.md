# LXC AutoScale

Welcome to the documentation for **LXC AutoScale**.

LXC AutoScale is a resource management daemon specifically designed for Proxmox environments. It automatically adjusts CPU and memory allocations and can clone LXC containers based on real-time usage metrics and predefined thresholds. Can be run locally or remotely to make your containers always optimized for performance, managing spikes in demand, and optionally preserving resources during off-peak hours.

LXC AutoScale offers two distinct options to suit different user profiles and environments:

## ðŸš€ LXC AutoScale
The default install option: ideal for new users and straightforward setups. This version provides a simple, out-of-the-box solution that automatically scale the resources of your Proxmox LXC containers. You can reconfigure it at any time or use it as a one-time solution when needed.

## âœ¨ LXC AutoScale ML
Designed for more complex environments, this version can be easily extended to fit large automated setups or custom integrations requiring machine-learning-driven autoscaling. It consists of three components: the API, the Monitor, and the Model.
